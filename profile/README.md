# Darkstar GmbH

The Darkstar Research and Developments GmbH was founded by Ralf Rastlos ([@vollsynthetik](https://github.com/vollsynthetik)) in 2022. It's aim is to research new ways and possibilities in IT security and software development.

# Current Projects

Not all of our projects are (currently) public, especially research repositories are private. But we do contribute to the open source community with various projects. Have a look at our teams and repositories to get an idea of what we are doing.

# Publicly released projects

We released a nice colorful dark Visual Studio Code theme that can be found here ([dark autumn vscode theme repository](https://github.com/Darkstar-GmbH/vscode-theme-dark-autumn)) and on the Visual Studio Marketplace ([vscode-theme-dark-autumn VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DarkstarGmbH.vscode-theme-dark-autumn)).

As a teaser you might wish to see some screenshots, no?

We have furthermore a [pull request](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine/pull/3734) pending on the [PsReadLine repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine/) that will allow for camel hump navigation, selection and deletion on the command line interface.

# Next to come

We are currently working on a [Module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/) for the [Microsoft Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) that will greatly enhance the TAB completion experience. We will announce it as soon as it gets ready.
