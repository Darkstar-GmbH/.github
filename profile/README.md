# Darkstar GmbH

The Darkstar Research and Developments GmbH was founded by Ralf Rastlos (@vollsynthetik) in 2022. It's aim is to research new ways and possibilities in IT security and software development.

# Current Projects

Not all of our projects are (currently) public, especially research repositories are private. But we do contribute to the open source community with various projects. Have a look at our teams and repositories to get an idea of what we are doing.

# Publicly released projects

We released a nice colorful dark Visual Studio Code theme that can be found here (vscode-theme-dark-autumn repository) and on the Visual Studio Marketplace. We have furthermore a pull request pending on the PsReadLine repository that will allow for camel hump navigation, selection and deletion on the command line interface.

# Next to come

We are currently working on a Microsoft Powershell module that will greatly enhance the TAB completion experience. We will announce it as soon as it gets ready.

# Contribution

If you are interested in what we are doing you can of course every time leave comments or drop us a line per mail. We highly appreciate your interest in our efforts and projects and would also like to team up. Don't hesitate to write us.

# Forks and Stars

Forks and Stars on our publicly visible repositories are always welcome. We promise to keep waiting times as short as possible for contribution in form of forks and pull requests.
